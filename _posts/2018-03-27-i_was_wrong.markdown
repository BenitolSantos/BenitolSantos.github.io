Yield is important. 
But the person who originally taught it to me had no idea how to use it. At all. Or even describe its practicality or its importance.

Yield wasn't useless. Aquaman isn't useless. The original person who taught me yield is useless.
*"You're just supposed to yield the code and it just yields the code. You're overthinking it. Just pass the tests. I don't get why you don't get it."*

**What a load of malarky. Who kicked this guy's dog?**

It appears to me, that this guy didn't get yield either. 

Yield makes every call to the method different depending on what you put into it. It's like a fingerprint, making every method call unique in itself.

Yield is beautiful because the beauty cannot seen in the method itself but in what it returns. Like different soil or different athmosphere makes the trees different, such is the same with yield.

He couldn't use yield correctly because he was trying to pass tests. Rather than discern the beauty of code and teach people how it works.
