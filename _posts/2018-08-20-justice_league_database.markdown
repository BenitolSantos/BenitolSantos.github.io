My experience writing this was long and painful. Oh wait. That was junior prom.

Anyway, I was challenged this project because the help was signifigantly less in doing most of the sections beforehand. Scraping itself was a pain. But it was fun to learn nokogiri. 


Originally I was going to scrape the main page of the wikia and all its characters on the front page.

That was a horrible idea.

For starters the main page looks like this.

http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/DC_Comics_Database

The layout of the main page constantly changes both based on the page admin and the version of wikia they use.
Which means it won't work if I try to scrape elements that constantly change.

On the bright side, I narrowed down the idea to the Justice League. Which was its own problem, due to the various incarnations  and subsections of the justice league. 

The DC universe is branded based on its ideas of the multiverse, and different iterations throughout history. Which means Justice League is different than its counterpart, Justice League Dark (deals in supernatural terrors), or Justice League of earth 57. And the justice league of earth 1 may not be the same post-crisis than pre crisis (Cataclysmic events which shape the comics, their form of AD and BC)

So, I chose Justice League prime earth, post flashpoint (timeline interference due to The Flash's mistake).

Then, I had to pick current members of the main section of the Justice League on prime earth without their Reserve members.

After all that was said and done, I had to re-go over nokogiri concepts, look over 5-6 hour long videos of concepts. Look over past  projects, (kickstarter, student, music cli, and nokogiri) while trying to create my own cli.

The cli constantly broke down (ERRORS ARE THE WORST). Ide constantly broke down. Github deleted my repository (NEVER USE GIT PUSH -F) I couldn't use ask a question, and people Slack couldn't help me much to differing schedules and the fact they had their own problems. Plus have you tried explaining parts of long code error over text? It's sort of impossible. I had events that popped up out of nowhere, hindering my time working on it. I had problems with my wifi.

Now I can safely say that my CLI scrapes the current members of Justice League Earth prime in the new 52. It scrapes both the Justice League's page and the indivivual members page in order to create a list based on their attributes under the status section of each members page. The justice league currently has nine, active, non reserve members. For some reason aquaman is the only one with a listed education, and only those who are nonhuman have their race listed under status. 


2 weeks. After all that. I finally finished it. With one help session left. 3/4.

Never give up. I got through it. Thank God. 

This is the coding superhero, and I just beat my first supervillain.
