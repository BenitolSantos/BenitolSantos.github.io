When you learn regex for the first time. It looks like a whole new language.  

Many, many parameters within those tiny // bars.

Regex is a kick to the teeth for people trying to learn programming for the first time. Some people avoid spending too much time in this particular area, while others camp here trying to learn the ropes on how to actually understand this. 

They even have multiple testing grounds,a cheat sheet, and multiple links on the subject.

Personally, I skipped much of what I needed to learn on the subject because it was a one and done small section that never seemed to come up again. 

But I was wrong. Its like the iceberg from titanic.

And I've only seen the tip.

It's painful. But like excercise and eating kale, it helps alot.
