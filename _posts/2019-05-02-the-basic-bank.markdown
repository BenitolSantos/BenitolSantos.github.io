Sorry for the long haul guys!

More than a year after I finished my first project in OOP, I run a bank.

Well, not really.

I created a bank from Sinatra.

After SQL, ORM, ACTIVERECORD, CSS and HTML revisited, it was pretty tough and I'm not even doing this part time.

But something is worth it about long hard journeys.

They create stronger people.

I figured, I'd skip all the extra stuff like mortages, loans, tax, alimony, interest and all that stuff because I don't have a business degree.

Instead, I'm making a virtual piggy bank.

So the idea is that I create users with various transactions. Those transactions can either be deposits or withdrawls. 

This incorperates everything I learned over that year.

The SQL databases and ORM for the databases.
The activerecord for the magic instant-methods.
The css and html for design and formatting.

All to understand CRUD and relationships. (Relationships are crud though)

Not that crud.
# 
# CREATE
# READ
# UPDATE
# DELETE
 
Many to one. Belongs to.


The Project Requirements were; (Official Page, overall.)

**Build an MVC Sinatra application.**
**Use ActiveRecord with Sinatra.**
**Use multiple models.**
**Use at least one has_many relationship on a User model and one belongs_to relationship on another model.**
**Must have user accounts - users must be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.**
**Validate uniqueness of user login attribute (username or email).
Once logged in, a user must have the ability to create, read, update and destroy the resource that belongs_to user.
Ensure that users can edit and delete only their own resources - not resources created by other users.
Validate user input so bad data cannot be persisted to the database.**
**BONUS: Display validation failures to user with error messages. (This is an optional feature, challenge yourself and give it a shot!)
**


**The specifications (checklist I completed) was;

**"# Specifications for the Sinatra Assessment

**Specs:
- [x] Use Sinatra to build the app
- [X] Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database
- [X] Include more than one model class (e.g. User, Post, Category)
- [X] Include at least one has_many relationship on your User model (e.g. User has_many Posts)
- [X] Include at least one belongs_to relationship on another model (e.g. Post belongs_to User)
- [X] Include user accounts with unique login attribute (username or email)
- [X] Ensure that the belongs_to resource has routes for Creating, Reading, Updating and Destroying
- [X] Ensure that users can't modify content created by other users
- [X] Include user input validations
- [] BONUS - not required - Display validation failures to user with error message (example form URL e.g. /posts/new)
- [X] Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code**
**
**Confirm
- [X] You have a large number of small Git commits
- [X] Your commit messages are meaningful
- [X] You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message
- [X] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message"**

*Daunting. But I did it. An it only took me a year.*
