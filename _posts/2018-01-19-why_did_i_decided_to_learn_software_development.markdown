Originally I wanted to become a video game programmer. I loved video games growing up. With the development of esports and gaming conventions like E3, I knew that I needed to start somewhere.

So I started out with an kodu game lab video game design. I even won an award for it. https://www.kodugamelab.com/

After that, the rest was me trying to become a computer engineer. That was tough because the community college I chose to go to did not have a computer engineering degree. I chose to graduate with a degree in engineering science. Which was far from what I intended to be.

Fortunately, even in my first programming class, (ALICE) I got better at my craft and even got and got an 94 on my "Time Crisis" inspired shooter.  https://www.alice.org/  

So I decided to quit college, (to much unhelpful teachers, stressful deadlines, expenses, etc) and started back  the way I came. Coding itself is like a game. With its own rewards and merits.
