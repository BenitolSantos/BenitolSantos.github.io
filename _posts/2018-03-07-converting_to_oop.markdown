OOP is for me is like learning how to diet after learning theres a pizza restaurant that just opened that everyone loves from your friends. 

Why

Don't get me wrong. I understand that it needs to be done. Just like that bowl of salad on the counter is not going to eat itself. But I spent 4 days trying to get my Turn method to work. 

Yes, I get that the importance of putting things in a class. And instance variables. and making dogs bark.
But that won? method I made before I learned OOP took me 3 days to make work. 

Sometimes you just wanna code like you're eating pizza.
