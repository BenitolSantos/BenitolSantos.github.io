  Notes are tough. Programming is tough.  All the syntax, all the debugging, the problem solving, All of it. But when you program over time it he stuff you do gets engrained in your memory.  But it makes sense though. Programming, in my opinion be understood unless you do it.

When you look at it, What does it mean? What does it do?

The only way to know is to let it do its thing. It has an easier flow when you put it in and let it comeout. 

In short notes < experience.
