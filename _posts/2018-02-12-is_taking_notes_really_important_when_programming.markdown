  Notes are tough. Programming is tough.  All the syntax, all the debugging, the problem solving, All of it. But when you program over time it he stuff you do gets engrained in your memory.  But it makes sense though. Programming, in my opinion be understood unless you do it.
	
	Look at this.
	
def greeting # Method Signature
  puts "Hello World" # Method Body
end # Method Closing


	When you look at it, What does it mean? What does it do?
	
	Sure, you could always write down the output. Take notes and try to memorize how it works. But the real way to develop your skills is practice. The only way to know is to let it do its thing. It has an easier flow when you put it in and let it comeout. 

In short notes < experience. Practical is always better.
